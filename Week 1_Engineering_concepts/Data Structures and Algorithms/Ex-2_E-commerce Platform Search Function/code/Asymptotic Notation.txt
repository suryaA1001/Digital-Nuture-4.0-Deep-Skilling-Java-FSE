In the context of search functionality on an e-commerce platform, it is crucial to understand how different search algorithms perform and which is more suitable based on dataset size and performance needs.
 
Linear Search :

Linear search checks each element in the list one by one until the desired product is found. It does not require the list to be sorted, making it simple to implement.

Best Case: O(1) – If the product is the first item in the list.

Average Case: O(n) – If the product is located somewhere in the middle.

Worst Case: O(n) – If the product is at the end or not present at all.

Use case: Suitable for small datasets where simplicity is more important than speed.

Binary Search :

Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the sorted list in half and comparing the middle element with the target. This results in significantly faster performance, especially as the size of the dataset increases.

Best Case: O(1) – When the product is exactly at the middle.

Average Case: O(log n) – As the list is halved each time.

Worst Case: O(log n) – Even when the product is not found.

Use case: Ideal for large datasets that are already sorted or can be sorted and indexed efficiently.
